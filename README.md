# NBA Sports Betting Model
This model will use a rolling average of recent performance data for each team in an NBA matchup to predict each winner. The model will be trained on previous seasons and tested on the current 2019-20 NBA season. Vegas odds are incorporated and a hypothetical $100 bet is placed on every game. The results are very exciting.
